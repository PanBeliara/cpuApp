# cpuApp
 Angular frontend client for CpuApi

A web application consuming CpuApi REST API. Created while learning this technology. Run by *ng serve* command or by running **\start.bat**.

## It provides:
- CRUD for Socket and Cpu tables
- Error message displaying
- Validation
- Some bootstrap-wise tricks (however it doesn't look so cutting-edge as I imagined, oh well)

It shouldn't return any error. Works on my machine etc. I should have placed some ngIf better so it would have looked better when loading tho.

## Requirements:
- node 12.18.2 or newer
- npm 6.14.5 or newer
- CpuApi client running (unless you don't care about the main features)
